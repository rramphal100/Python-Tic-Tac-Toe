# Python-Tic-Tac-Toe
Tic Tac Toe Game coded in python

I created this program for practice with coding in the Python language, which I had only recently learned when I created this game. Standard rules apply. 1st player uses the X symbol, second player uses the O symbol. Player order is picked at random. This is strictly a command line application.
